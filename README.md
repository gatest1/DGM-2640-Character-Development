My name is Taylor.  I am really excited to design my own dinosaur!  The dinosaur I was assigned was the Pachycephelasaurus!
It is a herbavore by nature with a beaked mouth lined with small teeth inside to chew its food.  It's most defining feature is it's domed head which it uses for ramming purposes.  When 'pachy' straightens it's spine, it is able to charge forward and deliver devastating blows with it's skull.
